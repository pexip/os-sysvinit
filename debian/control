Description: System-V-like init utilities
 This package contains programs required for booting
 a Debian system and doing basic process management.
 .
 The most important program in the package is /sbin/init.
 It is the first process started on boot and continues
 to run as process number 1 until the system halts. All
 other processes are descended from it.

Description: scripts for initializing and shutting down the system
 The scripts in this package initialize a standard Debian
 system at boot time and shut it down at halt or reboot time.

Package: bootlogd
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, lsb-base (>= 3.2-14)
Description: daemon to log boot messages
 bootlogd logs all messages printed to the system console during system boot,
 and records those messages to a logfile.
 .
 Note that not all init systems print messages to the system console,
 so that the logfile may remain empty; this is the case with systemd
 (the default init system). Try "journalctl -b" instead.
